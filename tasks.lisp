Content touched 2026-09-08 (uk-004, probe 003, the 002b gate correction) was already brought to Ukrainian-primary prose the same day; this task covers the remaining pre-existing debt. panca-vac/AGENTS.md already carries its own explicit Ukrainian-first language-policy section (unlike most sibling repos) -- this task operationalizes closing the gap against that repo's own stated policy.")
